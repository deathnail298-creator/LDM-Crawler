# LDM — Phase One Development Path  
## Transition from Phase Zero Concept → Validated Engineering Prototype

_Last Updated: Phase One Draft_

Phase One transforms the **Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM)** from a credible physics concept into a **measured, test-backed subsystem** suitable for consideration as a future lunar surface demo.

Phase Zero answered:  
> “Does this architecture make sense?”

Phase One answers:  
> “Does it actually work, and does it survive long enough to matter?”

The purpose of Phase One is **evidence**, not flight hardware.

## 1. Phase One Objectives

Phase One has four primary goals:

1. **Validate electrostatic loft efficiency** in vacuum using lunar regolith simulant.  
2. **Quantify micro-collision erosion** caused by terrace geometry (grain “softening”).  
3. **Assess long-duration survivability** of terraces and dielectric layers under realistic stress.  
4. **Establish validated models** (DEM, electrostatic, thermal) to project multi-year behavior.

Secondary goals:

- Characterize **HV cycling fatigue** of the dielectric stack.  
- Validate **power budget realism** vs. Phase Zero estimates.  
- Confirm **electronics coffin thermal stability** under extreme temperature swings.

At the end of Phase One, the LDM must either:

- **Advance** to Phase Two engineering model development,  
- **Advance conditionally** with specific redesigns, or  
- Be **terminated or heavily re-scoped** if core physics or survivability claims fail.

- validate its survivability,  
- and produce a defensible basis for a Phase Two engineering model and eventual lunar demo as a passive dust-conditioning asset for surface infrastructure.
