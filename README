LDM — Lunar Dust Mitigator
Phase Zero Technical Concept Package

(GitHub Version — README.md)

1. Executive Summary

The Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM) is a passive-first, long-duration lunar surface device designed to reduce regolith abrasiveness by ~5% within its operational zone.
This small shift in particle shape significantly improves wear rates on seals, radiators, solar arrays, landing pads, and rover systems across multi-year surface missions.

The LDM uses three simple mechanisms:

Electrostatic Lift of fine dust grains

Passive Agitation & Micro-Collision Erosion

Controlled Top-Down Redistribution

No moving parts.
No sensors.
No active dust-handling.
Just physics, geometry, and time.

LDM inherits the structural chassis from the original Crawler concept, leveraging its rugged, monotonic engineering style and simple delivery profile.

2. Motivation & Problem Context

Lunar regolith is a highly abrasive, angular, glass-like material created by micrometeorite impacts. It damages:

seals

radiators

solar panels

landing pads

rover wheels

suitports

optical surfaces

NASA has no practical method to “remove” lunar dust.
But small changes in angularity distribution produce large multi-year reliability benefits.

LDM addresses the problem by conditioning, not removing, regolith.

3. Phase Zero Design Rules & Constraints

Phase Zero mandates:

No moving parts

Passive-first engineering

Monolithic, dust-tolerant chassis

Long-duration operation

Fixed-geometry electrostatics

Passive thermal control

Simple, idiot-proof power system

Reuse of Crawler delivery architecture

Realistic success metrics

The machine must survive lunar vacuum, radiation, dust, thermal swings, and stupidity.

4. System Overview

The LDM consists of four major subsystems:

Chassis & Structural Frame — rugged mono-block body, Crawler-derived

Electrostatic Lift Array — simple fixed-bias plates under a dielectric skin

Passive Agitation Geometry — terraced, micro-channel top surface for collisions

Power/Thermal Backbone — fixed solar panel, low-duty battery, passive radiators

High-Level Behavior

Energize plates briefly

Lift fine dust

Dust falls onto terraces

Repeated collisions dull grain edges

Conditioned grains migrate outward

Slow cumulative effect improves local environment longevity

5.8 Local Environment Interaction

Dust lofting → collisions → redistribution

Slow outward migration of conditioned grains

6. Operating Principle

LDM operates through a five-step physics-driven loop:

Lift: Electrostatic plates loft fine regolith grains

Fall: Dust descends in clean ballistic arcs

Agitate: Terraces force repeated low-energy collisions

Redistribute: Particles migrate outward, spreading softening effects

Repeat: Over years, angularity distribution shifts measurably

The effect is cumulative, not instantaneous.

7. Mission Architecture (Phase Zero)
Deployment

Robotic placement

Attached to lander

Drop-and-set

Operating Cycle

1–5 minutes of plate energization

Followed by hours/days of passive dust interaction

Entire device sleeps 99% of the time

Footprint

3–15 meters radius (Phase Zero estimate)

Timeline

Year 1: Initial conditioning

Year 1–3: Stable churn zone forms

Year 3–10+: Footprint expands via regolith flow

End of Life

Fails silently into inert object or remains partially functional.

8. Technical Margins & Uncertainties

Key unresolved questions (normal for Phase Zero):

Variation in regolith loft efficiency

Exact per-cycle angularity reduction

Long-term terrace saturation behavior

Day/night thermal stress limits

Dielectric fatigue and arcing probability

Solar panel survivability under dust + UV

Electronics lifespan under thermal cycling

All uncertainties have defined Phase One test paths.

NASA expects to see this list.

9. Failure Modes & Graceful Degradation

All LDM failures are safe and silent:

Lift plates fail → dust stops lofting

Power fades → unit enters permanent sleep

Terraces clog → efficiency declines, no hazard

Thermal cracking → performance loss, not catastrophic

Burial → system becomes benign terrain object

No mode generates debris, throws dust, or threatens nearby hardware.

Footnotes & Heritage

This LDM architecture inherits the legacy Crawler delivery system philosophy:

“One piece, no nonsense”

“Passive-first”

“Survive the Moon and keep going”

“If it fails, it dies quietly”

This continuity is intentional and beneficial for NASA/contractor reviewers.
