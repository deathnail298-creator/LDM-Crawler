# LDM — Lunar Dust Mitigator  
_Phase Zero Concept Architecture_

The **Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM)** is a passive-first, long-duration lunar surface device designed to **reduce regolith abrasiveness by ~5%** within its operational zone.

That small shift in particle shape translates into meaningful improvements in:

- seal and bearing lifetime  
- radiator and solar array durability  
- landing pad and rover wear  
- contamination rates around habitats and surface hardware  

LDM achieves this using **no moving parts** and a simple combination of:

- **Electrostatic Lift** of fine dust grains  
- **Passive Agitation & Micro-Collision Erosion**  
- **Controlled Top-Down Redistribution**

The chassis and delivery logic inherit directly from the original **Crawler** architecture, keeping the design simple, rugged, and easy to manufacture.

## 1. Motivation

Lunar regolith is:

- sharp  
- angular  
- glass-like  
- electrostatically active  

It chews through:

- seals, cables, and bearings  
- solar panels and radiators  
- lander legs and rover wheels  
- suitport interfaces and optical systems  

You cannot “remove” lunar dust at scale.  
You _can_ locally **condition** it so the particles are slightly less hostile.

LDM aims for exactly that: a modest, local **statistical softening** of grain shapes that compounds over years of operation.

## 2. Phase Zero Design Rules

LDM follows strict Phase Zero constraints:

- **No external moving parts** in the dust-handling path  
- **Passive-first engineering** (geometry and physics do the work)  
- **Monolithic, dust-tolerant chassis** (Crawler heritage)  
- **Fixed-geometry electrostatics** (no feedback loops, no sensing)  
- **Passive thermal control** (no pumps, no valves)  
- **Simple power system** (fixed solar, low-duty battery, deep sleep)  
- **Graceful failure** (device fails silent and safe)  

If a choice exists between _clever_ and _simple_, Phase Zero chooses **simple** every time.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 High-Level Subsystems

1. **Chassis & Structural Frame**  
   - Rugged mono-block shell  
   - Minimal seams and dust traps  
   - Integrated thermal conduction paths  

2. **Electrostatic Lift Array**  
   - Fixed-voltage plates beneath a dielectric top layer  
   - Upward-directed field to loft fine regolith grains  
   - Extremely low duty cycle (minutes per day or less)  

3. **Passive Agitation Geometry**  
   - Terraces, channels, and basins machined or cast into the top surface  
   - Grains roll, slide, and collide at low energy  
   - Long-term micro-collision erosion blunts particles  

4. **Power & Thermal Backbone**  
   - Fixed solar panel (no deployment mechanisms)  
   - Small, slow-cycling battery  
   - Passive radiators and insulation  
   - Electronics in a sealed, potted “coffin”

## 4. Operating Principle

LDM operates on a simple, repeatable loop:

1. **Energize Plates**  
   - At fixed intervals, the embedded plates charge.  
   - Fine dust grains at the surface gain charge and are lofted upward.

2. **Ballistic Return**  
   - Plates turn off.  
   - Lofted grains fall back in clean ballistic trajectories (no atmosphere, no wind).

3. **Passive Agitation**  
   - Grains land on terraced geometry.  
   - They roll, slide, and collide with other grains at low energy.  
   - Over many cycles, sharp edges and fracture points are statistically reduced.

4. **Redistribution & Drift**  
   - Conditioned dust slowly migrates outward due to natural regolith creep and local activity.  
   - Fresh, sharper dust drifts into the footprint and is processed in future cycles.

5. **Long-Duration Compounding**  
   - Over years, the local grain-shape distribution shifts.  
   - Even a ~5% reduction in angularity can yield noticeable improvements in wear and fouling rates.

The effect is **slow**, **boring**, and **cumulative**—exactly the kind of behavior suitable for long-lived surface infrastructure.

## 5. Mission Architecture (Phase Zero)

### 5.1 Deployment

LDM is designed to be delivered using Crawler-style packaging:

- rigid body with no unfolding mechanisms  
- compatible with:  
  - robotic placement by a rover  
  - bolting to a lander structure  
  - simple “drop and set” emplacement  

After it is on the ground and sees sunlight, it begins autonomous operation.

### 5.2 Daily Cycle (Example)

- Wake from deep sleep  
- Energize plates for 1–5 minutes  
- Loft fine dust  
- De-energize and return to deep sleep  
- Let passive agitation and regolith flow do the rest

The device spends almost all of its life **asleep**, waking just long enough to perform the dust-conditioning action.

### 5.3 Footprint & Timescale

- Operational radius (Phase Zero estimate): **3–15 m** around the unit  
- Timescale: **years**, not days  

The goal is to quietly improve the local environment near:

- solar farms  
- radiators  
- lander pads  
- rover parking/maintenance zones  
- habitats and ISRU hardware

## 6. Technical Margins & Uncertainties (Phase Zero)

Known open questions include:

- Variability in electrostatic loft efficiency across different regolith types  
- Exact per-cycle effect on grain angularity  
- Long-term behavior of terraces under repeated dust loading  
- Solar panel degradation under dust + UV + radiation  
- Dielectric endurance under thermal cycling and high-voltage pulses  
- Electronics lifetime in a ±150 °C environment  

These are **Phase One** issues by design:  
Phase Zero defines the architecture and physics; Phase One tests and quantifies.

---

## 7. Failure Modes & Graceful Degradation

LDM is designed so that **all primary failures are safe and silent**:

- Loss of lift function → device simply stops conditioning dust  
- Power system fade → unit falls into permanent sleep  
- Terrace clogging → conditioning efficiency declines, no hazard  
- Micrometeorite or thermal damage → performance drops, not explosive failure  
- Regolith burial → system becomes inert terrain with a pre-conditioned patch of regolith beneath it  

In every case, the worst outcome is “it stops helping,” not “it causes a problem.”

---

## 8. Phase One Path (High-Level)

A future Phase One effort would:

- Validate electrostatic loft performance in vacuum with regolith simulant  
- Measure grain-shape evolution under repeated terrace interactions  
- Characterize terrace saturation and flow behavior  
- Run thermal cycling and dielectric endurance tests  
- Build a benchtop electrostatic testbed, a terraced mock-up, and an integrated engineering development unit (EDU)  
- Produce models (DEM, electrostatics, thermal) backed by experimental data  

The intent is to move from **credible concept** → **validated, test-backed technology** that can be considered for lunar surface demonstrations.

---

## 9. Heritage

LDM inherits:

- chassis philosophy  
- delivery packaging  
- ORC-style simplicity  

from the original **Crawler** architecture.

This design lineage is intentional:
- it reduces risk,  
- simplifies manufacturing,  
- and makes it easier for external teams to understand and prototype the system.
